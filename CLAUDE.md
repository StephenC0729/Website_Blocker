  Location & Structure:

  - File Path: src/dashboard/dashboard.html, src/dashboard/dashboard.js,
  src/dashboard/dashboard.css
  - Built with: React components from frontend/components/
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS utility classes

  Architecture:

  - Serverless-first design: All functionality runs locally using Chrome Storage API
  - No account registration required for core features
  - Local data persistence with Chrome's sync storage for cross-device sync
  - Authentication integration planned for Phase 5 (optional cloud sync only)

  Core Dashboard Features:

  1. Analytics & Visualizations (Phase 3)

  - Chart.js integration for interactive charts and statistics
  - Session tracking via analyticsService.js
  - Productivity metrics showing:
    - Time spent in focus sessions
    - Websites blocked statistics
    - Session completion rates
    - Daily/weekly/monthly trends
    - Time wasted statistics per blocked site
    - Most blocked sites tracking
    - Productivity score calculations
    - Block attempt frequency analysis

  2. Advanced Timer Management

  - Full Pomodoro timer interface
  - Session type switching (work/short break/long break)
  - Timer configuration and settings
  - Lockdown mode: prevent settings changes during active sessions
  - Different blocking rules for work vs break periods
  - Countdown warnings before session transitions

  3. Enhanced Blocking System

  - 6 Block Sets as Blocking Modes: Users can toggle between Off, Set 1, Set 2, Set 3, Set 4, Set 5, and Set 6 in the popup interface
  - Only one block set can be active at a time, functioning as distinct blocking modes
  - Each block set has independent configurations:
    - Custom website lists for that specific set
    - Time-based blocking: specific hours, days, and date ranges
    - Active days selection: weekdays, weekends, custom schedules
    - Block duration limits: block for X minutes after Y page visits
    - Delayed blocking: countdown warnings before actual block activation
  - Website blocking categories management per set
  - Add/remove/edit blocked sites by category within each set
  - Integration with Pomodoro timer: different sets can be automatically activated during work vs break periods

  4. Settings Management

  - Timer configurations (work/break durations)
  - Blocking preferences and schedules
  - Notification settings
  - UI preferences and themes
  - Security settings: Password protection, lockdown mode
  - Import/export settings functionality
  - Backup/restore configuration data
  - Options page for detailed configuration

  5. Authentication Integration (Phase 5)

  - Optional cloud sync functionality (serverless remains primary)
  - Google OAuth 2.0 or email/password login
  - Cross-device synchronization controls
  - Firebase cloud backup for settings and analytics data

  6. Data Visualization Components

  - Interactive charts showing productivity trends
  - Session completion statistics
  - Website blocking effectiveness metrics
  - Time distribution across different activities

  Technical Implementation:

  - Framework: React 18+ with hooks
  - State Management: Background service worker maintains state
  - Communication: Chrome Message API for extension communication
  - Storage: Chrome Storage API (local + sync) with optional Firebase Firestore backup
  - Charts: Chart.js for analytics visualizations
  - Local-first architecture with offline functionality

  The dashboard should be a comprehensive productivity analytics and management
  interface, far beyond the simple popup timer currently implemented.
