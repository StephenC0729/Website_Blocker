Location & Structure:

- File Path: src/dashboard/dashboard.html, src/dashboard/dashboard.js,
  src/dashboard/dashboard.css
- Built with: React components from frontend/components/
- Styling: Tailwind CSS utility classes

Architecture:

- Serverless-first design: All functionality runs locally using Chrome Storage API
- No account registration required for core features
- Local data persistence with Chrome's sync storage for cross-device sync
- Authentication integration planned for Phase 5 (optional cloud sync only)

Core Dashboard Features:

1. Analytics & Visualizations (Phase 3)

- [ ] Chart.js integration for interactive charts and statistics
- [ ] Session tracking via analyticsService.js
- [ ] Productivity metrics showing:
  - [ ] Time spent in focus sessions
  - [ ] Websites blocked statistics
  - [ ] Session completion rates
  - [ ] Daily/weekly/monthly trends
  - [ ] Time wasted statistics per blocked site
  - [ ] Most blocked sites tracking
  - [ ] Productivity score calculations
  - [ ] Block attempt frequency analysis

2. Advanced Timer Management

- [x] Full Pomodoro timer interface
- [x] Session type switching (work/short break/long break)
- [x] Timer configuration and settings
- [ ] **Timer-Blocking Integration**: Optional unified mode linking Pomodoro timer with blocking categories
  - [ ] Toggle to enable/disable unified mode (maintains backward compatibility)
  - [ ] Automatic category activation during focus sessions
  - [ ] Category switching during break periods
  - [ ] Per-category timer integration settings
- [ ] Lockdown mode: prevent settings changes during active sessions
- [ ] Updated notifications when a session ends
  - [ ] Different notification sounds for different session types (work/break)
  - [ ] User-configurable notification preferences in Settings Management
  - [ ] Optional browser notifications in addition to audio
  - [ ] Notification scheduling based on session completion patterns

3. Enhanced Blocking System

- [x] User-Created Blocking Categories: Users can create custom categories with personalized names and icons
- [x] Default "General" category provided as a starting point
- [x] Only one category can be active at a time, functioning as distinct blocking modes
- [x] Each category has independent configurations:
  - [x] Custom website lists for that specific category
- [x] Website blocking categories management with full CRUD operations
- [x] Add/remove/edit blocked sites by category within each custom category
- [ ] Enhanced timer integration with blocking categories (see Timer-Blocking Integration in Advanced Timer Management)

4. Settings Management

- [ ] Timer configurations (work/break durations)
- [ ] **Timer-Blocking Integration Settings**
  - [ ] Toggle unified mode on/off
  - [ ] Configure which categories activate for focus/break sessions
  - [ ] Integration behavior preferences
- [ ] Blocking preferences and schedules
- [ ] Notification settings
- [ ] UI preferences and themes
- [ ] Security settings: Password protection, lockdown mode
- [ ] Import/export settings functionality
- [ ] Backup/restore configuration data
- [ ] Options page for detailed configuration

5. Authentication Integration (Phase 5)

- [ ] Optional cloud sync functionality (serverless remains primary)
- [ ] Google OAuth 2.0 or email/password login
- [ ] Cross-device synchronization controls
- [ ] Firebase cloud backup for settings and analytics data

6. Data Visualization Components

- [ ] Interactive charts showing productivity trends
- [ ] Session completion statistics
- [ ] Website blocking effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Time distribution across different activities

Technical Implementation:

- Framework: React 18+ with hooks
- State Management: Background service worker maintains state
- Communication: Chrome Message API for extension communication
- Storage: Chrome Storage API (local + sync) with optional Firebase Firestore backup
- Charts: Chart.js for analytics visualizations
- Local-first architecture with offline functionality

The dashboard should be a comprehensive productivity analytics and management
interface, far beyond the simple popup timer currently implemented.
