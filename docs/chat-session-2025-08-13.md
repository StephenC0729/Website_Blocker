# Chat Session Archive - 2025-08-13

This file archives key assistant summaries and analysis from the session on 2025-08-13 regarding the current state of the Website Blocker extension.

## Repository Snapshot

Branch: `main`
Date: 2025-08-13

## High-Level Architecture Summary

- Background service worker manages blocklist + timer state via `chrome.storage.local` (keys: `blockedSites`, `timerState`).
- Content script checks current hostname and redirects to blocked page if needed.
- Popup implements a Pomodoro timer UI synced with background state.
- Dashboard provides expanded timer + planned analytics & blocklist management (many features still static scaffolding).
- AuthManager (localStorage-based) exists but not integrated into dashboard/popup flows.

## Implemented Features

- Flat blocklist of domains (string array) with navigation interception (`webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate`).
- Redundant content script enforcement to catch late redirects.
- Pomodoro timer (popup + dashboard) with sessions: pomodoro, short break, long break, custom (dashboard only) using timestamp-based sync.
- Dark mode toggle (basic).

## Not Yet Implemented (Per Spec / CLAUDE.md Intent)

- Multiple block list sets (Set1â€“Set6) & activation logic
- Category-based blocking CRUD
- Scheduling (days/hours, all-day)
- Analytics: session history, focus time aggregation, blocked site/category stats, charts population
- Cloud/Firebase authentication + sync
- Lockdown mode, password protection enforcement
- Settings persistence beyond timer defaults
- React component architecture / build pipeline

## Issues / Inconsistencies Identified

1. Blocked page path mismatch: code references `blocked.html` but actual path is `src/pages/blocked.html`.
2. Duplicate timer logic between popup and dashboard (risk of divergence).
3. Custom session duration (dashboard) not always persisted to background unless switching session with `customDuration` message.
4. Static blocklist UI markup (no dynamic data binding to storage).
5. nav-link style utility classes (`nav-link-active`, `nav-link-inactive`) not defined in provided CSS (may rely on missing custom utilities).
6. No analytics or history logging despite UI placeholders (empty charts, session history list).
7. Auth system unconnected to any restricted actions.
8. Inconsistent use of `localStorage` (auth) vs `chrome.storage.local` (core app data).

## Recommended Next Steps (Ordered)

1. Fix blocked page path references to ensure redirects succeed.
2. Extract shared timer client module to remove duplicate logic.
3. Introduce structured block sets data model in storage (`blockSets`).
4. Implement category & site CRUD (background message actions + dynamic rendering in blocklist component).
5. Add scheduling evaluation in background `checkAndBlockUrl`.
6. Add session history logging & populate dashboard stats and charts.
7. Persist notification & custom timer settings; enforce them on timer events.
8. Implement lockdown/password gating of settings while focus session active.
9. Gradually integrate AuthManager (or replace with Firebase in future) to sync user-specific data.
10. Consider migration to a module bundler if React adoption proceeds.

## Suggested Data Structures

```
blockSets: {
  active: "set1" | "off",
  sets: {
    set1: {
      categories: {
        social: { name:"Social Media", enabled:true, icon:"fas fa-users", sites:["facebook.com", ...] },
        ...
      },
      schedule: { days:[1,2,3,4,5], start:"09:00", end:"17:00", allDay:false },
      rules: { mode:"strict"|"pomodoro-linked", delaySeconds:0, maxVisitsBeforeBlock:null }
    },
    ...
  }
}

timerState: {
  isRunning, currentSession, timeLeft, totalTime, startTimestamp,
  sessionCount, pomodoroCount,
  sessions: { pomodoro:{duration,label}, short-break:{...}, long-break:{...}, custom:{...} },
  history: [ { id, type, start, end, duration, completed } ]
}
```

## Edge Cases to Handle

- Concurrent popup + dashboard controlling timer
- Rapid domain redirects (ensure minimal flicker)
- Subdomain matching (decide exact vs substring)
- Schedule crossing midnight boundaries
- Storage write contention (batch or debounce updates)

## Proposed New Shared Utilities

- `src/shared/utils/url.js` for `cleanUrl`
- `src/shared/services/timerClient.js`
- `src/shared/services/blockSetService.js`
- `src/shared/services/analyticsService.js`

## Minimal Immediate Fix Patch (Planned but Not Yet Applied Here)

- Replace `chrome.runtime.getURL('blocked.html')` with `chrome.runtime.getURL('src/pages/blocked.html')` in:
  - `src/background/background.js`
  - `src/content/content.js`

## Follow-Up Options

- Request implementation of immediate fix
- Start block set data model
- Add dynamic rendering to blocklist page
- Add analytics logging scaffold
