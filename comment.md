⏺ I'll analyze the frontend codebase to identify what components and files haven't been implemented yet. Let me start by exploring the current frontend structure.

⏺ Based on my analysis of the frontend codebase compared to the CLAUDE.md requirements, here are the missing components that need to be implemented:

  Missing JavaScript Files

  1. dashboard.js - Referenced in index.html:284 but doesn't exist
    - Should contain Chart.js initialization and data visualization logic
    - Analytics service integration for productivity metrics
    - Dashboard-specific timer and blocking functionality
  2. analyticsService.js - Core analytics tracking service
    - Session tracking and productivity metrics calculation
    - Local storage management for analytics data
    - Chart data preparation and statistics generation

  Missing Core Features

  Analytics & Visualizations (Phase 3)

  - Chart.js integration - HTML containers exist but no JavaScript implementation
  - Interactive charts for:
    - Weekly productivity trends (weeklyChart canvas in dashboard-content.html:132)
    - Category breakdown pie chart (categoryChart canvas in dashboard-content.html:145)
  - Productivity metrics calculations - placeholders exist but no data logic
  - Session history tracking - container exists but no population logic

  Advanced Timer Management

  - Enhanced timer controls - basic structure exists but missing advanced features:
    - Lockdown mode implementation
    - Different blocking rules for work vs break periods
    - Session type switching automation
    - Timer configuration persistence

  Enhanced Blocking System

  - 6 Block Sets functionality - UI exists in blocklist-content.html but no JavaScript logic
  - Block set switching - selector exists but no implementation
  - Time-based blocking - schedule settings UI exists but no logic
  - Category management system - modals exist but no CRUD operations

  Settings Management

  - Settings persistence - settings panel exists but no save/load functionality
  - Password protection - UI exists but no authentication logic
  - Import/export settings - not implemented
  - Security features - lockdown mode, password validation

  Data Management

  - Chrome Storage API integration - minimal implementation
  - Local data persistence - basic structure but needs expansion
  - Cross-device sync - not implemented
  - Backup/restore functionality - missing entirely

  Missing Service Files

  1. Storage service - for Chrome Storage API abstraction
  2. Block management service - for website blocking logic
  3. Settings service - for configuration management
  4. Timer service - for enhanced Pomodoro functionality

  Existing vs Required

  ✅ Already Implemented:
  - Basic HTML structure and Tailwind CSS styling
  - Popup timer with session switching
  - Navigation and routing system
  - Modal dialogs for category/website management
  - Basic Chrome extension manifest and structure

  ❌ Missing Implementation:
  - All JavaScript business logic except basic popup timer
  - Chart.js data visualization
  - Analytics tracking and metrics calculation
  - Advanced blocking system with 6 sets
  - Settings persistence and management
  - Chrome Storage API integration for data persistence

  The codebase has excellent HTML/CSS structure but lacks almost all JavaScript functionality required for the full dashboard experience described in CLAUDE.md.
