# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The App Blocker Dashboard Enhancement project aims to transform the existing basic Chrome extension into a comprehensive productivity management platform. The current extension provides basic Pomodoro timer functionality and website blocking capabilities, but lacks advanced analytics, category management, and user customization features. This enhancement will add a full-featured dashboard with productivity analytics, advanced blocking controls, and user authentication capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a productivity-focused user, I want to view detailed analytics of my focus sessions, so that I can track my productivity patterns and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display today's total focus time in hours and minutes
2. WHEN I view the productivity overview THEN the system SHALL show weekly focus time statistics
3. WHEN I access the analytics section THEN the system SHALL display the number of sites blocked today
4. WHEN I check my progress THEN the system SHALL show my session completion rate as a percentage
5. WHEN I view recent activity THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list of my last 10 completed sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who gets distracted by different types of websites, I want to organize blocked sites into categories, so that I can manage my blocking preferences more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the website blocking section THEN the system SHALL display existing categories with their associated websites
2. WHEN I click "Add Category" THEN the system SHALL open a modal allowing me to create a new category with a name and list of websites
3. WHEN I save a new category THEN the system SHALL store the category and immediately display it in the categories list
4. WHEN I view a category THEN the system SHALL show all websites associated with that category
5. WHEN I delete a category THEN the system SHALL remove the category and all its associated blocking rules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who wants flexible blocking options, I want to choose between different blocking modes, so that I can control when websites are blocked based on my current activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access blocking settings THEN the system SHALL offer "Pomodoro Mode" and "Strict Mode" options
2. WHEN I select "Pomodoro Mode" THEN the system SHALL only block websites during active work sessions
3. WHEN I select "Strict Mode" THEN the system SHALL block websites at all times regardless of timer state
4. WHEN I change blocking modes THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new blocking behavior
5. WHEN a timer session ends in Pomodoro Mode THEN the system SHALL temporarily allow access to previously blocked sites during breaks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who wants to customize my productivity workflow, I want to configure timer durations and notification preferences, so that I can adapt the tool to my personal work style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open settings THEN the system SHALL display current timer configurations for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks
2. WHEN I modify timer durations THEN the system SHALL validate that values are within acceptable ranges (1-60 minutes for work, 1-30 for short break, 1-60 for long break)
3. WHEN I save timer settings THEN the system SHALL apply new durations to future timer sessions
4. WHEN I configure notifications THEN the system SHALL offer options for desktop notifications, sound alerts, and auto-start breaks
5. WHEN I enable desktop notifications THEN the system SHALL request browser permission and show notifications when sessions complete

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user concerned about maintaining my productivity settings, I want security options to prevent accidental changes, so that I can maintain consistent productivity habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable password protection THEN the system SHALL require password entry before allowing settings modifications
2. WHEN I set up password protection THEN the system SHALL require password confirmation and store it securely
3. WHEN I enable lockdown mode THEN the system SHALL prevent all settings changes during active timer sessions
4. WHEN lockdown mode is active and I try to change settings during a session THEN the system SHALL display a message explaining the restriction
5. WHEN a timer session ends with lockdown mode enabled THEN the system SHALL restore normal settings access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants reliable local data management, I want all my settings and analytics data stored locally in the browser, so that the dashboard works completely offline without requiring any external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the dashboard THEN the system SHALL store all data using Chrome Storage API without requiring internet connectivity
2. WHEN I modify settings or categories THEN the system SHALL immediately persist changes to local storage
3. WHEN I restart the browser or extension THEN the system SHALL restore all my previous settings and data from local storage
4. WHEN I view analytics THEN the system SHALL calculate all statistics from locally stored session data
5. WHEN the extension updates THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing user data and settings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data-driven user, I want to visualize my productivity trends through charts and graphs, so that I can understand my work patterns and make informed decisions about my productivity habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the weekly productivity chart THEN the system SHALL display a line graph showing daily focus time for the past 7 days
2. WHEN I access the category breakdown chart THEN the system SHALL show a pie chart displaying the distribution of blocked site categories
3. WHEN I hover over chart elements THEN the system SHALL display detailed tooltips with specific values and percentages
4. WHEN I view charts with no data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messages
5. WHEN chart data updates THEN the system SHALL animate transitions smoothly without jarring visual changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a future-oriented user, I want the system to be designed with extensibility in mind, so that server-based features like cloud sync and authentication can be added later without disrupting the core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is architected THEN it SHALL use modular design patterns that separate data storage from business logic
2. WHEN data operations are implemented THEN the system SHALL use abstraction layers that can support multiple storage backends
3. WHEN the dashboard is built THEN it SHALL include placeholder UI elements for future authentication features
4. WHEN local storage is implemented THEN the system SHALL use data structures compatible with future cloud synchronization
5. WHEN the extension is complete THEN it SHALL function as a fully-featured productivity tool without requiring any server components
