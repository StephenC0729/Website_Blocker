# Chat Session Archive - 2025-08-13

This file archives key assistant summaries and analysis from the session on 2025-08-13 regarding the current state of the Website Blocker extension.

## Repository Snapshot

Branch: `main`
Date: 2025-08-13

## High-Level Architecture Summary

- Background service worker manages blocklist + timer state via `chrome.storage.local` (keys: `blockedSites`, `timerState`).
- Content script checks current hostname and shows overlay blocking interface if site is blocked.
- Popup implements a Pomodoro timer UI synced with background state.
- Dashboard provides expanded timer + planned analytics & blocklist management (many features still static scaffolding).
- AuthManager (localStorage-based) exists but not integrated into dashboard/popup flows.

## Implemented Features

- Category-based website blocking system with active category selection via `categorySites` and `categoryMetadata` storage.
- Multiple block list sets (via custom categories) with activation logic - users can create multiple categories and activate one at a time.
- Category-based blocking CRUD operations - full create/read/update/delete for categories and their websites.
- Content script overlay blocking that displays full-screen blocking interface when accessing blocked sites.
- Pomodoro timer (popup + dashboard) with sessions: pomodoro, short break, long break, custom (dashboard only) using timestamp-based sync.
- Dark mode toggle (basic).

## Not Yet Implemented (Per Spec / CLAUDE.md Intent)

- Scheduling (days/hours, all-day)
- Analytics: session history, focus time aggregation, blocked site/category stats, charts population
- Cloud/Firebase authentication + sync (with initial local data migration to cloud on first login)
- Lockdown mode, password protection enforcement
- Settings persistence beyond timer defaults
- React component architecture / build pipeline

## Recommended Next Steps (Ordered)

1. Extract shared timer client module to remove duplicate logic.
2. Introduce structured block sets data model in storage (`blockSets`).
3. Add scheduling evaluation in background `checkAndBlockUrl`.
4. Add session history logging & populate dashboard stats and charts.
5. Persist notification & custom timer settings; enforce them on timer events.
6. Implement lockdown/password gating of settings while focus session active.
7. Gradually integrate AuthManager (or replace with Firebase in future) to sync user-specific data.
8. Consider migration to a module bundler if React adoption proceeds.


## Edge Cases to Handle

- Concurrent popup + dashboard controlling timer
- Overlay display timing (ensure minimal flicker when blocking activates)
- Subdomain matching (decide exact vs substring)
- Schedule crossing midnight boundaries
- Storage write contention (batch or debounce updates)

## Domain matching analysis ‚Äî 2025-08-16

Current content check (src/content/content.js):

- Exact match OR a subdomain rule that‚Äôs effectively disabled: `host === site || (host.endsWith('.' + site) && !site.includes('.'))`
- Resulting behavior:
  - Adding `translate.google.com.my` blocks only that exact host.
  - Adding `google.com` does not block `*.google.com` (e.g., `translate.google.com`), because the subdomain rule is gated off by `!site.includes('.')`.
  - Adding a subdomain (e.g., `translate.google.com`) does not block parent domains (e.g., `google.com`).

Pitfall that caused earlier confusion:

- If a symmetric or substring check is used (e.g., `host.endsWith(site)` without the leading dot, `site.endsWith(host)`, or any `includes`-based test), it will wrongly couple parent and subdomain:
  - Block `translate.google.com` ‚Üí `google.com` is also blocked.
  - Block `google.com` ‚Üí all subdomains get blocked.

Desired options going forward:

- Exact-only: `host === site`.
- Parent ‚Üí subdomain: `host === site || host.endsWith('.' + site)` (no reverse checks, no substring includes).
- Public Suffix-aware: to distinguish `google.com` vs `google.com.my`, use a PSL-based parser if you need registrable-domain logic.

Dev tip:

- Reload the unpacked extension in chrome://extensions after code changes; reloading a page alone won't update content/background scripts or packaged pages.

## Unused Functions Analysis ‚Äî 2025-08-16

After comprehensive analysis of all JavaScript files in the project, the following functions appear to be unused and could potentially be removed:

### Confirmed Unused Functions:

1. **`merge` function** - `src/background/storage.js:31`

   - Purpose: Merges new data with existing storage data
   - Status: Exported but never called anywhere in the codebase
   - Safe to remove: Yes

2. **`getCategoryBlockedSites` function** - `src/background/categories.service.js:110`

   - Purpose: Returns flat array of blocked sites from enabled categories
   - Status: Exported but not referenced in messaging.js or any other files
   - Safe to remove: Yes, unless planned for future content script integration

3. **`openSettings` method** - `src/popup/popup.js:476`

   - Purpose: Placeholder for settings functionality in PomodoroTimer class
   - Status: Defined but never called, shows alert "Settings feature coming soon!"
   - Safe to remove: Yes, until actual settings implementation

4. **`removeOverlay` method** - `src/content/content.js:190`

   - Purpose: Removes blocking overlay and restores normal page interaction
   - Status: Defined but no code path currently calls it
   - Safe to remove: No - needed for future overlay dismissal features

5. **`updateFromBackground` methods** - `src/popup/popup.js:351` and `src/dashboard/dashboard-timer.js:302`
   - Purpose: Periodic background state synchronization for timer updates
   - Status: Defined but never invoked by any timer or interval logic
   - Safe to remove: No - likely needed for cross-interface timer synchronization

### Module Export Patterns (Not Browser Extension Compatible):

6. **Module exports in dashboard files**
   - Files: `dashboard-main.js`, `dashboard-timer.js`, `dashboard-utils.js`, `blocklist-functionality.js`, `faq-functionality.js`
   - All contain `module.exports` blocks for Node.js compatibility
   - Status: Not used since project uses browser globals, not CommonJS modules
   - Safe to remove: Yes - these are browser extension files, not Node.js modules

### Summary:

- **Safe to remove**: `merge()`, `getCategoryBlockedSites()`, `openSettings()`, and all `module.exports` blocks
- **Keep for future features**: `removeOverlay()`, `updateFromBackground()` methods
- The codebase is generally well-structured with clear usage patterns through Chrome extension messaging and event listeners
- Most unused functions appear to be either utility functions prepared for future features or placeholder implementations

## Category Management Status ‚Äî 2025-08-17

### What works

- Add/remove categories and sites with persistence via `categorySites` and `categoryMetadata`.
- Delete category removes both sites and metadata.
- Active category selection is persisted and used by the content script for runtime blocking.
- Migration removes legacy `enabled` flags and sets a default active category on install/update.

### Gaps / bugs

- Subdomain matching bug in `src/content/content.js` renders the subdomain branch effectively unreachable due to `&& !site.includes('.')`.
- Legacy `toggleCategoryBlocking` path and `enabled` concept remain in code but are unused by the UI after migration.
- No category edit/rename flow; potential slug collisions when generating `categoryId` from the name.
- UI shows all categories regardless of the active selector; the ‚ÄúCurrently viewing‚Äù label updates but list is not filtered.
- Changing the active category does not trigger re-check on already open tabs; blocking only evaluated on page load.
- Dropdown in ‚ÄúAdd Website‚Äù uses option text (name) to locate the category DOM; should rely on `value` (id) to avoid name duplication issues.
- `general` category metadata is not guaranteed in storage (UI hardcoded), causing minor inconsistency with other categories.

### Actionable TODOs

- Fix subdomain check in content script to support parent‚Üísubdomain blocking only:
  ```
  // Desired behavior: block exact match or any subdomain of a blocked parent
  const isBlocked = sites.some(site => host === site || host.endsWith('.' + site));
  ```
- Remove unused legacy path: delete `ACTIONS.TOGGLE_CATEGORY_BLOCKING` handling and `toggleCategoryBlocking()`; keep migration.
- Implement category rename/edit UI and slug de-duplication (e.g., append `-2`, `-3` on collisions).
- Align ‚ÄúAdd Website‚Äù to use `categoryId` from the select `value` and locate category DOM via `[data-category="<id>"]`.
- Optionally filter the categories list to only the selected active category for clarity (or add a toggle to show all).
- Broadcast active category changes and listen in content scripts to re-evaluate blocking without reload (e.g., message `activeCategoryChanged`).
- Consider adding metadata for `general` in storage on migration for consistency.

## Unified Timer-Blocking Feature Status ‚Äî 2025-08-20

### Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

Verified unified toggle, settings, orchestrator, and message routing exist and are consistent across popup.js, settings.service.js, unified-orchestrator.js, and messaging.js.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- Unified Orchestrator (`src/background/unified-orchestrator.js`) - Session coordination logic
- Settings Service (`src/background/settings.service.js`) - Configuration management  
- UI Toggle (`src/popup/popup.html:30-33`) - "Unify timer and blocklist" checkbox
- Message routing integration with extension messaging system
- Automatic category switching during focus/break sessions
- Session state management and notification system

### Recommended Enhancements üîß

**Priority: High** - These improvements are essential for a polished unified experience:

1. **Real-time Content Script Updates** (`src/content/content.js`):
   - Add storage listener for `activeCategory` changes
   - Implement dynamic overlay removal when categories switch
   - Enable immediate blocking state changes without page reload

2. **Automatic Break Completion Handling**:
   - Call `handleBreakComplete()` when break timers end
   - Ensure proper category restoration after break sessions
   - Prevent manual intervention requirements between timer phases

**Current Gap**: When unified timer switches categories (focus ‚Üí break), existing tabs don't respond until reloaded. Overlays may persist inappropriately when sites should become accessible during breaks.

**Expected Outcome**: Seamless real-time blocking updates as timer phases change, eliminating need for manual page reloads.

## Unified Mode UX Optimization Plan ‚Äî 2025-08-21

### Current State Analysis
The unified mode feature exists in the popup with both toggle control and detailed category selection dropdowns (`popup.html:27-72`). While functional, this creates UI clutter and suboptimal user experience.

### Recommended Split Implementation

**Popup Page (Quick Controls)**:
- ‚úÖ Keep unified mode toggle switch - frequently used on/off control
- üîÑ Remove detailed category selection dropdowns to reduce clutter  
- üîÑ Show current active categories when unified mode is enabled
- üîÑ Streamline interface for mobile-friendly popup experience

**Dashboard Page (Detailed Configuration)**:
- üîÑ Move category selection controls (Focus Category, Break Category) to dashboard settings
- üîÑ Add advanced unified mode configuration options:
  - Per-category timer integration settings
  - Automatic switching preferences  
  - Integration behavior customization
- üîÑ Implement progressive disclosure for power users

### Implementation Benefits
1. **Frequency-Based Design**: Toggle (daily use) vs Configuration (set-and-forget)
2. **Space Optimization**: Cleaner popup interface with reduced vertical space usage
3. **User Mental Model**: Popup = "Do something now", Dashboard = "Configure how things work"  
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple toggle for new users, detailed config for power users
5. **Mobile-Friendly**: Simplified popup works better in constrained popup window

### Tasks
- [ ] Move category selection dropdowns from popup to dashboard settings page
- [ ] Add "current categories" display to popup when unified mode is active
- [ ] Implement advanced unified mode settings in dashboard
- [ ] Update unified orchestrator to read configuration from dashboard settings
- [ ] Ensure settings persistence across popup/dashboard interfaces
- [ ] Test user flow from popup toggle to dashboard configuration
